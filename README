WHAT IT DOES

It pull down the RSS feed from http://sixy.ch/feed
It add other IP address and host names to ips.csv
Uses this to perform the tests for HE.
If test fail it repeats the test.


It is a quick piece of code to the job so it is not very well written so don't be too critical of it, however improvements/feedback to edmundwatson@gmail.com 



FILES
he.php - The main run. Edit with your details.
getips.php - this script update the ips.csv from 
ips.php - list the IPs in ip.csv 
ipshtml.php - list the IPs in ip.csv in html

GENERATE FILE
ip.csv - a list of ips from http://sixy.ch/feed encoded in base 64
number.txt - keeps a reference of how far though ip.csv
my_cookies.txt - keeps a cookie for loging in.
%test%.html - the returned document for debugging
%test%raw.html - the submission to he for debugging

INSTALLATION/RUNNING 

You need php (been tested on 5.3.6 and 5.2.17) with curl

place where you want it.

edit the top of 

he.php

you can run it manally 

# php he.php

and/or add cron task like this

# crontab -e
and add
* 1 * * * /opt/bin/php /%WHERE YOU PUT IT%/he.php >>/var/log/he 2>>/var/log/he
This will repeat it daily. You may want to increase the frequecy if you find it doesn't pass 24 hour on he system.
Outputs to /var/log/he, you may want to turn off debug in he.php if you have a small system, the /var/log/he file doesn't fill up.
